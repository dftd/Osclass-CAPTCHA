"reCAPTCHA learns by seeing real traffic on your site. For this reason, "
"scores in a staging environment or soon after implementing may differ from "
"production. As reCAPTCHA v3 doesn't ever interrupt the user flow, you can "
"first run reCAPTCHA without taking action and then decide on thresholds by "
"looking at your traffic in the admin console. By default, you can use a "
"threshold of 0.5."
